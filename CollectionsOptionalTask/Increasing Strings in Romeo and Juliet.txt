ACT V. Scene I.
I hear him near.
Friar. Who is it?
Thy lips are warm!
and a crow of iron.
Warm and new kill'd.
Bal. I dare not, sir.
Man. No, my good lord.
These dead men's tombs.
Nurse. O lamentable day!
Apoth. Who calls so loud?
[Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
[Exeunt some of the Watch.]
Enter Montague [and others].
[Exeunt others of the Watch.]
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
Friar. Go with me to the vault.
Unto the rigour of severest law.
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Till we can clear these ambiguities
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
And then I ran away to call the watch.
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
And I, for winking at you, discords too,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for
Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
